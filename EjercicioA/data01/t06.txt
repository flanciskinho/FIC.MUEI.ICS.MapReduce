Definition - What does MapReduce mean?

MapReduce is a programming model introduced by Google for processing and generating large data sets on clusters of
computers.

Google first formulated the framework for the purpose of serving Google’s Web page indexing, and the new framework
replaced earlier indexing algorithms. Beginner developers find the MapReduce framework beneficial because library
routines can be used to create parallel programs without any worries about infra-cluster communication, task monitoring
or failure handling processes.

The MapReduce framework has two parts:

A function called "Map," which allows different points of the distributed cluster to distribute their work.
A function called "Reduce," which is designed to reduce the final form of the clusters’ results into one output.
MapReduce runs on a large cluster of commodity machines and is highly scalable. It has several forms of implementation
provided by multiple programming languages, like Java, C# and C++.

Techopedia explains MapReduce

The main advantage of the MapReduce framework is its fault tolerance, where periodical reports from each node in the
cluster are expected when work is completed.

A task is transferred from one node to another. If the master node notices that a node has been silent for a longer
interval than expected, the main node performs the reassignment process to the frozen/delayed task.

The MapReduce framework is inspired by the "Map" and "Reduce" functions used in functional programming. Computational
processing occurs on data stored in a file system or within a database, which takes a set of input key values and
produces a set of output key values. Numerous MapReduce programs and MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters
each day. Programs are automatically parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The runtime
system deals with partitioning the input data, scheduling the program's execution across a set of machines, machine
failure handling and managing required inter-machine communication. Programmers without any experience with parallel and
distributed systems can easily use the resources of a large distributed system.

MapReduce is used in distributed grep, distributed sort, Web link-graph reversal, Web access log stats, document
clustering, machine learning and statistical machine translation.
